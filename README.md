Billing Solution 

BDS2012: DentaSoft
History:
This is a program inspired by a Dental Studio. 
The Dental Studio manufactures and sells prosthetic
dental appliances to dentists for patient use. The 
dental studio deals with written paper bills and 
needed a solution to record and produce printable 
and presentable invoices for end of the month 
billing purposes; and to recall information in the 
future.

How the program works:
The user will enter the required info pertaining to 
the bill; upon completing the bill, the information 
is found in a text file: 
C:\DentaSoft Billing\New Created DentaSoft Bill.txt

Bugs:
One little glitch, when we enter an invalid amount, 
the information about the previous bill remains visible. 
It does not affect the functionality.
